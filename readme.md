# hsf - portfolio

This project is a portfolio website made for Hugo Singerl√© Florus who is a french designer.

This website is built using :

- [Gatsby](https://gatsby.org) - Static site generator based on react-js. I use it a lot theses times (almost for all of my websites)
- [Forestry](https://forestry.io) - Headless CMS based on git. Clearly one of my favorite with [strapi](https://strapi.io).
